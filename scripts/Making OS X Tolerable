Making OS X Tolerable

If you're like me, an engineer from a Linux friendly tech school like MIT, you've probably gotten quite comfortable with your favorite GNU/Linux Distro (I like Ubuntu/Debian/Mint). In the real world, I've noticed that a lot of tech companies are not ok with your OS of choice and settle on OS X as the corporate and management approved operating system that any bum on the street can use.

If you're in this situation, here's how to make your new Mac almost as good as developing on Ubuntu, or at least tolerable.


First, since OS X lacks a decent package manager. We'll install Homebrew.

    ruby -e "$(curl) -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go"

I'm disappointed that this requires Ruby (OS X does have Ruby installed by default so I suppose this is OK). This will display the changes about to be made and propt for your password. 

Next, run 

    brew doctor

This lists missing requirements before Homebrew can be used. First, you'll need "Command Line Tools for XCode". Despite most of the documentation online, you do NOT need to install XCode to get the command line tools. The full XCode 4.6.2 install is 1.65 GB and contains iOS and OS X software development kit bloat. We really just want gcc and other command line utilities.

Navigate to http://developer.apple.com/downloads find "Command Line Tools (OS X Mountain Lion) for Xcode April 2013" or whichever release is most recent. Download the .dmg and install it.

The Command Line Tools for Xcode should now be installed along with Git 1.7.12.4. Now running "brew doctor" should display "Your system is ready to brew."

Download Chrome
wget https://dl.google.com/chrome/mac/stable/GGRO/googlechrome.dmg
open ~/Downloads/googlechrome.dmg
sudo cp -r /Volumes/Google\ Chrome/Google\ Chrome.app /Applications/

brew cask install google-chrome
brew cask install firefox
brew cask install sublime-text
brew cask install dropbox

brew cask install virtualbox
brew cask install vagrant

# Python
https://python-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx.html

# Replace the outdated default OS X Python installation. These brew formulas now also install Pip and Distribute (provides deprecated easy_install command as well)
brew install python --framework      # Python 2.7.5, distribute 0.6.45, pip 1.3.1
brew install python3 --framework     # Python 3.3.2, distribute 0.6.45, pip 1.3.1

# Add the Homebrew versions of Python to the Path
echo "export PATH=/usr/local/share/python:$PATH" >> .bashrc

pip install --upgrade distribute
pip install --upgrade pip

# Virtualenv and Virtualenvwrapper
pip install virtualenv






Finder -> Preferences -> New Finder Windows Show. Select your username.
Sidebar Tab. Uncheck All My Files, AirDrop, and all Shared Components. And check your username.


Next, we'll install some basic utilities that would normally be available on any Linux machine.


Switch Control and Command keys in the Keyboard settings.
Turn off natural scrolling.
Dock on the left.
