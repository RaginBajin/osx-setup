# OS X Setup (OS X v10.8.4)

I use these (opinionated) setup scripts to automate the configuration of my development machines starting from a fresh OS X installation. The overall goal is to speed the process of setting up a development machine and provide the peace of mind that everything is configured in a way that I believe to be the `correct` way.


# Quickstart

Before following the Quickstart guide, I would recommend that you fork this project and tweak it in a few places (for example, your Git identity settings are not the same as mine) and peruse the scripts to ensure you are comfortable with what they do.

1. Select 'Clone to Desktop' from the Github [page](https://github.com/dghubble/osx-setup)
2.     cd ~/Desktop/osx-setup
3.     bash ./bootstrap.sh
4. Manually perform the tasks listed in osx-setup/manual.txt 


# Pro Tips

+ Create an OS X USB Startup Disk so that you can perform your own fresh installs 


# Contributing

My machine setup strategy is evolving and I'm working to integrate provisioning and version controlled configurations into my setup strategy. As my own setup strategy changes, this repository will be updated to reflect those changes.

If you have any suggestions or corrections, create a Pull Request and I'll consider merging them. Bear
